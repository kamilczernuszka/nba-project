Add Live Scores feature to SportsPress. Give your visitors the ability to view the results without refreshing your page.

== Description ==

Treat your visitors with live scores directly on your site. This plugin is an extension for SportsPress.

Define the structure of your sport and deliver real-time minutes to your visitors. 

You can define periods that track minutes such as 1st & 2nd Half in Soccer and periods which do not track time (and even pause it) such as Timeouts (Basketball, Handball) or Penalties (after 120 minutes in soccer)
